#This is my first application development
1. Download composer
    `https://getcomposer.org/download/`
    * during installation use the php.exe form xampp folder
2. Restart the vscode
3. run the folllowing command in xampp/htdocs:
    `composer create-project laravel/laravel <name of the app>`
4. wait until it finishes

5. now let's setup local env:
    * setup the server response
    `xampp\apache\conf'extra httpd-vhost.conf`
    * then add this to hosts  
    `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`  
    whatever is there at the very bottom  

6. restart server on xampp
that's it. very nice trick done...
