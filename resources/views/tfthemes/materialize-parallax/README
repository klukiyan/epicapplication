LARAVEL THEMEFACTORY THEME
==========================

Thank you for trying out ThemeFactory.net!

INSTALLATION
------------

Just simply unzip the downloaded zip file in your main Laravel folder (ie: `unzip theme123.zip`)
It should place all the files in their required folders, for example:

/public/tfthemes/theme123/css/...
/public/tfthemes/theme123/js/...
/public/tfthemes/theme123/images/...
/resources/views/tfthemes/theme123/README
/resources/views/tfthemes/theme123/master.blade.php
/resources/views/tfthemes/theme123/home.blade.php
... and so on

Update your `app/Http/routes.php` file to use the new theme, for example:

Route::get("/", function(){
  return View::make("tfthemes.theme123.home"); 
});
